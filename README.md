# Purpose

Scripts to harden Windows 10 and Windows 11.
Assist to remove unnecessary Windows apps, disable telemetry, inactivate bloatware and disable unecessary or insecure default features and enable some security features.
Attempts to improve security and privacy posture.

# Specificity of this tool

The "difference" of this tool is a focus on granularity (1 script for one 1 control) as all-in-one scripts are rapidly impossible to use or obsolete or difficult to use and maintain.
A current profile (TBC) would be the update of the day sequence of each required specic unique control. Obsolete controls would be moved to a deprecated folder.

# Usage

This tool is mainly focused on a **powershell** approach and add others scripts ( batch, powershell, python, ansible ) for reference. Scripts are in <https://github.com/blue101010/Windows10Debloater/tree/master/security/default> driectory
